            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I'm an incoming junior studying Computer Science at <a href="http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm"> Tianjin University</a> . </p>
            <p>Janan is my English name. Although ‚ÄúJanan‚Äù sounds like a girl's name, I am actually a boyüòÜ. (And my real name also sounds like a girl's name.üëø)</p>
            <p>The first year and a half in TJU was really a disaster for me. I learnt almost nothing from school curriculum and assignments. I had to say that many courses are just a piece of sh*t cause' teachers tediously taught outdated materials and students competed for GPA in a non-sense and even crazy way. Although "class gets in the way of your studies" sounds like a joke, it's the truth, at least for me. I had no way to change the status quo of the school. I suffered from the rubbish courses a lot and finally chose to tank.</p>
            <p>As I lost interest in most of my courses, I spend most of my time on sports, playing games and aimlessly reading books and browsing the web. As for schoolwork, I only spend a small fraction of the time doing it perfunctorily.</p>
            <p>After being wasted like this for a year or so, I realized that I couldn't be this decadent any longer. I want to do things that excite me and make sense. And from that time, I began to think what I really want to do in the future.</p>
            <p>Luckily, I found my answer in Zhihu. I have to say that <a href="https://zhihu.com">Zhihu</a> is really a high-quality Chinese network platform (I didn't experienced the era of <a href="https://douban.com">Douban</a> which is another high-quality Chinese network platform. But it has gone from prosperity to decline, and many big names and veterans have gone to Zhihu). If you pay a little attention, you can find a lot of valuable content and information. It was here that I learned about Silicon Valley programmers, overseas doctoral students, financial investors, their lifestyles and life experiences. They let me know what the world is like, what the world could be like and what the world should be like on a larger scale. It also made me more aware of what China is like and the gap between China and the world. The best country in the world is not China. (Maybe "good" is a vague word, but I still want to use it).</p>
            <p>That is, I want to keep my eyes on the world and learn the latest current affairs and knowledge around the world: cryptocurrency, web 3.0 and so on. I will study machine learning on couresa, enjoy celebrities' podcast and videos on YouTube and think of scientists and programmers' ideas on Twitter, instead of poor quality undergraduate programs in my school. I want to exchange ideas with people all over the world and compete with them.</p>
            <p>May be it was late to realize what I want in my sophomore year. But I'm still grateful. At least I'm not 20 yet. I'm still young. I know too many stories about people who have lived their lives in a muddle. With the goal, I am now living a full day: continue to hone my English until I reach the level of an English native speaker; keep a good rest, diet and exercise, the body is the capital of revolution; Reinforce my professional knowledge, not only AI theory, but also coding level. Learn finance, cryptography, crypto currency and all the decentralization thoery.</p>
            <p>There is a saying on Zhihu that has a great influence on me: "Only by constantly broadening our knowledge boundaries can we gain real freedom." You have to master at least one of the physical freedom and the spiritual freedom. (What I want to express here of freedom is the freedom of thought, freedom of wealth and freedom of speech, not the liberty of physical body. Freedom and liberty are two concepts. Freedom tends to be a kind of unrestrained and undisciplined status, while the liberty of body and mind requires long-term self-discipline and exercise to eliminate your laziness and greed, etc. Spiritual freedom can be achieved by constantly acquiring knowledge and enriching yourself.)</p>
            <p>Now, for the future, I am constantly seeking opportunities to discovery, to learn, to build things that interest me, excite me, and impact people.</p>
